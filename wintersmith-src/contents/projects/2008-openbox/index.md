OpenBox is an easy-to-implement in-page popup window, similar to the
popular image gallery tool,
[Lightbox](http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/), except that
OpenBox can present any type of content. OpenBox uses unobtrusive
Javascript and is powered by the lightweight
[MooTools](http://mootools.net/) Javascript framework.

OpenBox is highly configurable and is targeted towards web designers who
are comfortable with CSS and HTML and have a little exposure to
Javascript (OpenBox does all the heavy lifting).
