My blog covers topics related to front-end web development and design,
with occasional tutorials and demos. The inspiration comes from the
helpful niche sites that were indispensable to me in my first years as a
developer, and I hoped to give back to that community. Crafting every
post also has the added benefit of coalescing my learnings for my own
record.

The blog is custom-built and hand-coded from front to back on the
[CodeIgniter MVC framework](http://codeigniter.com/). Although I was
using the MVC pattern at the time for work, building every layer of this
site (rather than just focusing on the client-side) helped me to fully
understand it.

Because CodeIgniter is based on PHP, I've found it relatively easy to
port over plugins from popular platforms like WordPress, such as the
very useful [Akismet](http://akismet.com/).
