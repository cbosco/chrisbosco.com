The Aviary photo editor was a truly fun product to build and maintain. It was pivotal in a couple of ways -- it pushed the boundaries of what could be done in a Web browser without a plugin installed, and it marked a transition at Aviary from the Flash-based suite of creative tools to the HTML5 and native mobile offering that propelled the company into an entirely new business.

At the time of writing, the Web-based photo editor is integrated as a third-party JavaScript widget in a number of high-traffic websites including Flickr, Yahoo! Mail, Photobucket, Squarespace, and MailChimp, among others.

The biggest challenges involved reaching a very high level of performance, polish, and detail in the user interface, developing tactics to manage a very large JavaScript code base, providing intuitive theming and a modern API to developers, and running as a third-party plugin in an unpredictable landscape.

The highlights of my work included meeting and supporting developers at hackathons (including Aviary's own [Photo Hack Day](http://photohackday.org/)) and seeing their excitement and ideas for the editor.

The end of my time at Aviary was spent mostly building tools to help improve developer experience -- allowing code refactor without headaches (back-filling unit tests) and making sure our partners were not disrupted before a new release (PhantomJS-powered automated screenshot tool).
