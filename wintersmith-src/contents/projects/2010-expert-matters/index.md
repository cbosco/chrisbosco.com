Expert Matters is a media site built on Drupal 6 and meant to showcase
content based on organic popularity and to categorize it intelligently
based on automated feature extraction as well as manual editorial input.

I began work on Expert Matters along with consultants from
[Acquia](http://acquia.com/) who trained a team of developers
including myself in Drupal development. Over a six-month period I became a
full-fledged Drupal themer with some experience in module development
through designing and implementing features from front to back-end.

I was able to learn a great deal from the back-end developers, and vice
versa, as we all were new to the technology and patterns. In addition,
my specialized area of theme-building was a challenging exercise as I
worked with a design team used to completely custom-developed sites and
pixel-perfect mockups.
