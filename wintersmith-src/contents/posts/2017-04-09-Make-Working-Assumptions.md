This should sound familiar: stub out pieces of software when writing tests; focus on finishing the unit. You can extend this approach to an even higher level: delivering a working software feature itself. 

I'm sure you, as a developer, know that specs are never complete. Further, it's human nature to find corner cases after work has begun and you've committed to it, instead of during planning and design phases. Developers elevate laziness to an art.

In big companies or teams an attitude of "not my problem to solve" can also arise leading to dips in momentum or completely halted progress when a developer encounters the inevitable "undesigned" workflow step or corner case the product designer may have missed. Cue some elaborate communication chain back to the original designer and a "blocked" alert to everyone involved. 

Rather than falling into this trap, favor forward motion and immediately tackle this problem yourself. The goal here, as always, is effective communication so avoid rabbit holes at all costs and find the shortest path to a "stub" for this missing piece, documenting it if that helps (it probably will). The important part is to be completely transparent about this, and completely remove ego. Assume your working assumption will be thrown out part and parcel.

However in trade you will gain:

* Feedback on your own solution to a problem (however small -- even coming up with a label for a form field can be a design challenge). You'll grow as a designer and broaden your skills. 
* Unblocked progress: Keep the momentum going and deliver at least a working prototype of a feature closer to on time
* Trust: Despite incomplete spec you'll be seen as having owned the task from start to finish
* Added context and more structured conversation: By moving forward you'll build a working feature around your questions, adding context that is probably needed (it was missed,  right?). You may even come away a with a better understanding of the business problem, something that can make you much more effective in the future. 

While collaboration in general is a great goal, often times the stakeholder is hoping that you'll completely own a feature with minimal supervision but still be open to feedback and a giving her the final word on what will ship to users. Plan and account for this and as always try to get to a feedback stage as soon as possible - with working software instead of a list of esoteric questions.  The more often you do this the better you will get by building intuition around fast, but useful solutions, and ultimately saving your team real time.
