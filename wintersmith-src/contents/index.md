Hello world.

This is where I tell you about what I do.

I'm a Web software builder who loves design, the Internet, and the challenge of communication.  I write about geeky things at [cbsides.com](http://blog.cbsides.com/) and as [@cbsides](http://www.twitter.com/cbsides) on Twitter.  I contribute to open source as [cbosco](https://github.com/cbosco). My [résumé](http://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbosco) is on LinkedIn.

You can contact me directly at [contact@chrisbosco.com](mailto:contact@chrisbosco.com).
